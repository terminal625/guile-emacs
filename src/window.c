MINIBUF nil or omitted means consider the minibuffer window only if the
minibuffer is active.  MINIBUF t means consider the minibuffer window
even if the minibuffer is not active.  Any other value means do not
consider the minibuffer window even if the minibuffer is active.

ALL-FRAMES nil or omitted means consider all windows on WINDOW's frame,
plus the minibuffer window if specified by the MINIBUF argument.  If the
minibuffer counts, consider all windows on all frames that share that
minibuffer too.  The following non-nil values of ALL-FRAMES have special
meanings:

- t means consider all windows on all existing frames.

- `visible' means consider all windows on all visible frames.

- 0 (the number zero) means consider all windows on all visible and
  iconified frames.

- A frame means consider all windows on that frame only.

Anything else means consider all windows on WINDOW's frame and no
others.

If you use consistent values for MINIBUF and ALL-FRAMES, you can
use `previous-window' to iterate through the entire cycle of
acceptable windows, eventually ending up back at the window you
started with.  `next-window' traverses the same cycle, in the
reverse order.  */)

The following values are recognized:

nil means splitting a window will create a new parent window only if the
    window has no parent window or the window shall become part of a
    combination orthogonal to the one it is part of.

`window-size' means that splitting a window for displaying a buffer
    makes a new parent window provided `display-buffer' is supposed to
    explicitly set the window's size due to the presence of a
    `window-height' or `window-width' entry in the alist used by
    `display-buffer'.  Otherwise, this value is handled like nil.

`temp-buffer' means that splitting a window for displaying a temporary
    buffer always makes a new parent window.  Otherwise, this value is
    handled like nil.

`display-buffer' means that splitting a window for displaying a buffer
    always makes a new parent window.  Since temporary buffers are
    displayed by the function `display-buffer', this value is stronger
    than `temp-buffer'.  Splitting a window for other purpose makes a
    new parent window only if needed.

t means that splitting a window always creates a new parent window.  If
    all splits behave this way, each frame's window tree is a binary
    tree and every window but the frame's root window has exactly one
    sibling.

Other values are reserved for future use.  */);
